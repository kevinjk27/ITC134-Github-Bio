My name is Kevin Kantono and I was born in Indonesia. I completed my Bachelor degree in Singapore with major in Business Marketing. As soon as I graduated, I went back to Indonesia to work on a building material store. After working for more than 4 years, I have observed how retail has shifted gradually from brick-and-mortar to click-and-mortar. To comprehend it, I enrolled in Seattle Central College’s web development program.

I have huge interest in aviation. When I was a kid, I had always wanted to become a pilot. Preferable to be commercial pilot but fighter pilot would be better. Well until now it’s just still a dream. I've been always fascinated on how the marvellous engineering and technology that constantly improving to bring air travel become more efficient, reliable and safer. As a plane enthusiast, travelling to new places is clearly my biggest interest too.
